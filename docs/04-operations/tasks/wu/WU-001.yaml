  Add a modulo operation to the calculator package.
  
  Context: Users need remainder calculation for various use cases.
  Problem: No modulo function exists in the calculator package.
  Solution: Add Modulo() function with proper error handling.

acceptance:
  - Modulo(a, b) returns the remainder of a divided by b
  - Returns ErrDivisionByZero when b is zero
  - Unit tests cover positive, negative, and zero cases
  - Test coverage >= 80%

  Follow TDD: write failing test first, then implement.
